  **Design Movement**: "Clinical Zen" / Modern Medical Minimalism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Clarity above all**: Information hierarchy must be instantly scannable.
  2. **Calm Authority**: Use soft, reassuring visuals to counter the stress of compliance.
  3. **Precision**: Grid alignments and typography must be mathematically perfect to reflect compliance accuracy.
  4. **Human-Centric**: Focus on the people (caregivers, residents) protected by the software, not just the software itself.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Medical Blue (#1F7AE0) - Represents trust, authority, and the NHS/medical connection.
  - **Secondary**: Soft Sage Green - Represents safety, "pass" status, and growth.
  - **Backgrounds**: Off-white/Cream (oklch(0.99 0.01 100)) instead of stark white to reduce eye strain and feel more "caring".
  - **Accents**: Warm Amber for "attention needed" but not alarming.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Use a split-screen hero with a large, emotive image on one side and clean typography on the other.
  - **Floating Cards**: Content sections (features, testimonials) float on the background with soft, large-spread shadows to create depth without heavy borders.
  - **Whitespace Channels**: Wide vertical margins to guide the eye down the page effortlessly.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **"The Compliance Shield"**: A subtle shield motif used in icons and background patterns.
  - **Soft-Focus Photography**: Images of care interactions with a slight blur/overlay to make them feel like memories or ideals.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Generous border-radius (1rem+) on all cards and buttons to feel friendly and safe.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Gentle Feedback**: Buttons scale down slightly on click; hover states are subtle brightness shifts, not drastic color changes.
  - **Smooth Reveal**: Content fades in and slides up as the user scrolls (ScrollReveal).

  **Animation**:
  - **Hero Entrance**: Text staggers in line-by-line. Hero image scales up gently.
  - **Scroll**: Elements have a "parallax" feel where background shapes move slower than foreground content.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Plus Jakarta Sans* - Geometric, modern, and highly legible.
  - **Body**: *Inter* - Standard, clean, and invisible to the reader.
  - **Hierarchy**: Massive, bold headings (text-5xl+) paired with spacious, medium-weight body text (text-lg).

  **Design Movement**: "Data Brutalism" / High-Tech Compliance
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Radical Transparency**: Show the data, show the dashboard, show the metrics immediately.
  2. **Systematic Order**: The design should feel like a perfectly organized filing cabinet or database.
  3. **Contrast & Impact**: High contrast to highlight critical information (pass/fail).
  4. **Efficiency**: Dense information density that is still readable.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Electric Blue (#2563EB) - Digital, energetic, and tech-forward.
  - **Secondary**: Slate/Charcoal - Serious, grounded, and professional.
  - **Backgrounds**: Very light grey grid patterns on white.
  - **Accents**: Neon Green for "Compliant", Sharp Red for "Non-Compliant".

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Bento Grid**: The entire site is structured like a dashboard, with content contained in modular, grid-aligned boxes.
  - **Sticky Sidebar/Header**: Navigation is always present and robust.
  - **Visible Grid Lines**: Subtle borders between sections to emphasize structure.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Monospace Accents**: Use a monospace font for data points, dates, and "system status" elements.
  - **Dashboard Previews**: Abstracted UI elements (charts, toggles) used as decorative graphics.
  - **Tech Textures**: Dot grids, circuit-like lines connecting elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy**: Instant hover states, no fade-ins. Things snap into place.
  - **Data Visualization**: Charts animate (grow/fill) when they enter the viewport.

  **Animation**:
  - **Micro-interactions**: Hovering over a "feature card" triggers a mini-animation of that feature (e.g., a toggle switching on).
  - **Loading**: A "system check" style loading sequence.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* - Technical, slightly quirky, distinct.
  - **Body**: *JetBrains Mono* (for data) mixed with *Roboto* (for text).
  - **Hierarchy**: Uppercase labels, bold numbers, structured lists.

  **Design Movement**: "Warm Professionalism" / The Human Side of Care
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Empathy First**: The design acknowledges the difficulty of care work.
  2. **Soft & Organic**: Avoid sharp edges and harsh contrasts.
  3. **Storytelling**: The page unfolds a narrative of "Before vs. After" using the software.
  4. **Trust & Heritage**: Feels established, reliable, like a long-standing institution.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Navy Blue (#1e3a8a) - Classic, trustworthy, deep.
  - **Secondary**: Warm Beige/Sand - Human, grounding, natural.
  - **Backgrounds**: Warm white, paper textures.
  - **Accents**: Soft Coral for warmth and highlights.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Magazine Style**: Large, editorial typography mixed with high-quality photography.
  - **Overlapping Layers**: Images overlap text sections slightly to create connection.
  - **Flowing Shapes**: Backgrounds use organic, wave-like dividers instead of straight lines.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Serif Headings**: Use a modern serif for a touch of elegance and authority.
  - **Hand-Drawn Elements**: Subtle underlines or circles to highlight key points, making it feel "human".
  - **Portrait Photography**: Focus on faces of happy staff and residents.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Slow & Deliberate**: Transitions are slow and graceful (ease-out-sine).
  - **Tactile**: Buttons have a "pressed" state that feels physical.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Drift**: Images slowly drift (Ken Burns effect).
  - **Text Reveal**: Text fades in from the bottom up.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Merriweather* or *Playfair Display* - Trustworthy, editorial.
  - **Body**: *Lato* - Friendly, round, easy to read.
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, serif quotes; clear, readable paragraphs.
